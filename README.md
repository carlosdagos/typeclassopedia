Solving some of the exercises of the [Typeclassopedia](https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia).

The solutions are for exercises as of March 2016.

This includes some of my thoughts, notes, and personal explanations.

## Not finished

Not finished. Some of these solutions I'm unsure of :)

Also, the formatting may be off, as I've done this really fast between train stations and airports.

I'll be fixing it all in due time.

## License

There's really no license.
